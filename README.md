Urban Data Mapping Assignment 3

## Writeup Section

1. Compare the outputs for 2013 and 2019. What are some visible differences between these two time periods?
> Several areas of the map had visible differences in light level compared to the 2013 counter part. Using the division tool, it was easy to see which areas had more activity in regards to light level at the end of 2019.
2. Using the quick OSM plugin, download the OSM data for Singapore. Filter throught the data and display the data that makes the most sense to you.
> Our group used Buildings and Bars in Singapore. These areas are likely to have more walkable traffic as people who are going to these locations would likely see a retail store as well. This is conversely compared to something like a water processing plant or industrial area.
3. If you feel itâ€™s needed, browse online for more data which could help you understand the growth in nighttime lights between 2013 and 2019.
4. Using the data and raster files you acquired for Singapore imagine you were asked by a retail store chain to provide an analysis of which areas of Singapore are experiencing the most economic growth.
